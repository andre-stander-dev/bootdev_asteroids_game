# Pygame Asteroids Game

This is a simple Asteroids-style game built using Python and Pygame, created as an assignment from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev). The game involves controlling a spaceship to shoot and destroy asteroids while avoiding collisions. When large asteroids are hit, they split into smaller ones, adding more challenge to the gameplay.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Control the spaceship with `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move forward, backward, and rotate.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: Press the `SPACE` key to shoot bullets.
- **Asteroid Splitting**: Large asteroids split into two smaller ones when destroyed, adding more difficulty to the game.
- **Collision Detection**: Player and asteroid collisions result in game over; bullets and asteroid collisions result in asteroid splitting or destruction.

## Game Controls

- **W**: Move forward
- **S**: Move backward
- **A**: Rotate left
- **D**: Rotate right
- **SPACE**: Shoot bullets

## Installation

To run this game, you'll need Python 3 and Pygame installed on your machine.
